# GNN Project

Welcome to the **GNN Project**! Here, I illustrate an approach to apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict molecular properties of [Porphyrin-Based Dye](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/cp/c3cp54050b). Molecular data (including atomic structure , grand-gap energy, ect.) comes from DTU's [Center for Atomic-Scale Materials Design Database](https://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/).
